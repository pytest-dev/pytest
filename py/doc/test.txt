================================
The ``py.test`` tool and library 
================================

.. contents::
.. sectnum::


This document is about the *usage* of the ``py.test`` testing tool. There is
also document describing the `implementation and the extending of py.test`_.

.. _`implementation and the extending of py.test`: impl-test.html

starting point: ``py.test`` command line tool 
=============================================

We presume you have done an installation as per the
download_ page after which you should be able to execute the
'py.test' tool from a command line shell. 

``py.test`` is the command line tool to run tests. You can supply it
with a Python test file (or directory) by passing it as an argument::

  py.test test_sample.py

``py.test`` looks for any functions and methods in the module that
start with with ``test_`` and will then run those methods.  Assertions
about test outcomes are done via the standard ``assert`` statement.

This means you can write tests without any boilerplate::

    # content of test_sample.py 
    def test_answer():
        assert 42 == 43 

You may have test functions and test methods, there is no
need to subclass or to put tests into a class. 
You can also use ``py.test`` to run all tests in a directory structure by
invoking it without any arguments::

  py.test

This will automatically collect and run any Python module whose filenames 
start with ``test_`` or ends with ``_test`` from the directory and any
subdirectories, starting with the current directory, and run them. Each 
Python test module is inspected for test methods starting with ``test_``.

.. _features: 

Basic Features of ``py.test`` 
=============================

assert with the ``assert`` statement
------------------------------------

Writing assertions is very simple and this is one of py.test's
most noticeable features, as you can use the ``assert``
statement with arbitrary expressions.  For example you can 
write the following in your tests:: 

     assert hasattr(x, 'attribute') 

to state that your object has a certain ``attribute``. In case this
assertion fails the test ``reporter`` will provide you with a very
helpful analysis and a clean traceback.

Note that in order to display helpful analysis of a failing
``assert`` statement some magic takes place behind the
scenes.  For now, you only need to know that if something
looks strange or you suspect a bug in that
*behind-the-scenes-magic* you may turn off the magic by 
providing the ``--nomagic`` option. 

how to write assertions about exceptions 
----------------------------------------

In order to write assertions about exceptions, you use
one of two forms::

    py.test.raises(Exception, func, *args, **kwargs) 
    py.test.raises(Exception, "func(*args, **kwargs)")

both of which execute the given function with args and kwargs and
asserts that the given ``Exception`` is raised.  The reporter will
provide you with helpful output in case of failures such as *no
exception* or *wrong exception*.

Skipping tests 
----------------------------------------

If you want to skip tests you can use ``py.test.skip`` within
test or setup functions.  Example::

    py.test.skip("message")

You can also use a helper to skip on a failing import::

    docutils = py.test.importorskip("docutils")

or to skip if the library does not have the right version::

    docutils = py.test.importorskip("docutils", minversion="0.3")

automatic collection of tests on all levels
-------------------------------------------

The automated test collection process walks the current
directory (or the directory given as a command line argument)
and all its subdirectories and collects python modules with a
leading ``test_`` or trailing ``_test`` filename.  From each 
test module every function with a leading ``test_`` or class with 
a leading ``Test`` name is collected.  The collecting process can 
be customized at directory, module or class level.  (see 
`collection process`_ for some implementation details). 

.. _`generative tests`: 
.. _`collection process`: impl-test.html#collection-process

generative tests: yielding more tests
------------------------------------- 

*Generative tests* are test methods that are *generator functions* which
``yield`` callables and their arguments.  This is most useful for running a
test function multiple times against different parameters.
Example::

    def test_generative(): 
        for x in (42,17,49): 
            yield check, x 
    
    def check(arg): 
        assert arg % 7 == 0   # second generated tests fails!

Note that ``test_generative()`` will cause three tests 
to get run, notably ``check(42)``, ``check(17)`` and ``check(49)``
of which the middle one will obviously fail. 

To make it easier to distinguish the generated tests it is possible to specify an explicit name for them, like for example::

    def test_generative(): 
        for x in (42,17,49): 
            yield "case %d" % x, check, x 


.. _`selection by keyword`: 

selecting tests by keyword 
--------------------------

You can selectively run tests by specifiying a keyword 
on the command line. Example:: 

    py.test -k test_simple 

will run all tests that are found from the current directory 
and where the word "test_simple" equals the start of one part of the 
path  leading up to the test item.  Directory and file basenames as well 
as function, class and function/method names each form a possibly
matching name. 

    Note that the exact semantics are still experimental but 
    should always remain intuitive.   

testing with multiple python versions / executables 
---------------------------------------------------

With ``--exec=EXECUTABLE`` you can specify a python
executable (e.g. ``python2.2``) with which the tests 
will be executed. 


testing starts immediately 
--------------------------

Testing starts as soon as the first ``test item`` 
is collected.  The collection process is iterative 
and does not need to complete before your first 
test items are executed. 

no interference with cmdline utilities 
--------------------------------------

As ``py.test`` mainly operates as a separate cmdline 
tool you can easily have a command line utility and
some tests in the same file.  

debug with the ``print`` statement
----------------------------------

By default, ``py.test`` catches text written to stdout/stderr during
the execution of each individual test. This output will only be
displayed however if the test fails; you will not see it
otherwise. This allows you to put debugging print statements in your
code without being overwhelmed by all the output that might be
generated by tests that do not fail.

Each failing test that produced output during the running of the test
will have its output displayed in the ``recorded stdout`` section.

The catching of stdout/stderr output can be disabled using the 
``--nocapture`` option to the ``py.test`` tool.  Any output will 
in this case be displayed as soon as it is generated.

test execution order
--------------------------------

Tests usually run in the order in which they appear in the files. 
However, tests should not rely on running one after another, as
this prevents more advanced usages: running tests
distributedly or selectively, or in "looponfailing" mode,
will cause them to run in random order. 

useful tracebacks, recursion detection 
--------------------------------------

A lot of care is taken to present nice tracebacks in case of test
failure. Try::

    py.test py/documentation/example/pytest/failure_demo.py

to see a variety of 17 tracebacks, each tailored to a different
failure situation.

``py.test`` uses the same order for presenting tracebacks as Python
itself: the outer function is shown first, and the most recent call is
shown last. Similarly, a ``py.test`` reported traceback starts with your
failing test function and then works its way downwards. If the maximum
recursion depth has been exceeded during the running of a test, for
instance because of infinite recursion, ``py.test`` will indicate
where in the code the recursion was taking place.  You can  
inhibit traceback "cutting" magic by supplying ``--fulltrace``. 

There is also the possibility of usind ``--tb=short`` to get the regular Python
tracebacks (which can sometimes be useful when they are extremely long). Or you
can use ``--tb=no`` to not show any tracebacks at all.

no inheritance requirement 
--------------------------

Test classes are recognized by their leading ``Test`` name.  Unlike
``unitest.py``, you don't need to inherit from some base class to make
them be found by the test runner. Besides being easier, it also allows
you to write test classes that subclass from application level
classes.

disabling a test class
---------------------- 

If you want to disable a complete test class you
can set the class-level attribute ``disabled``. 
For example, in order to avoid running some tests on Win32:: 

    class TestEgSomePosixStuff: 
        disabled = sys.platform == 'win32'
    
        def test_xxx(self):
            ... 

testing for deprecated APIs
------------------------------

In your tests you can use ``py.test.deprecated_call(func, *args, **kwargs)``
to test that a particular function call triggers a DeprecationWarning. 
This is useful for testing phasing out of old APIs in your projects. 

Managing test state across test modules, classes and methods 
------------------------------------------------------------

Often you want to create some files, database connections or other
state in order to run tests in a certain environment.  With
``py.test`` there are three scopes for which you can provide hooks to
manage such state.  Again, ``py.test`` will detect these hooks in
modules on a name basis. The following module-level hooks will
automatically be called by the session::

    def setup_module(module):
        """ setup up any state specific to the execution
            of the given module. 
        """

    def teardown_module(module):
        """ teardown any state that was previously setup 
            with a setup_module method. 
        """

The following hooks are available for test classes::

    def setup_class(cls): 
        """ setup up any state specific to the execution
            of the given class (which usually contains tests). 
        """

    def teardown_class(cls): 
        """ teardown any state that was previously setup 
            with a call to setup_class.
        """

    def setup_method(self, method):
        """ setup up any state tied to the execution of the given 
            method in a class.  setup_method is invoked for every 
            test method of a class. 
        """

    def teardown_method(self, method): 
        """ teardown any state that was previously setup 
            with a setup_method call. 
        """

The last two hooks, ``setup_method`` and ``teardown_method``, are
equivalent to ``setUp`` and ``tearDown`` in the Python standard
library's ``unitest`` module.

All setup/teardown methods are optional.  You could have a
``setup_module`` but no ``teardown_module`` and the other way round.

Note that while the test session guarantees that for every ``setup`` a
corresponding ``teardown`` will be invoked (if it exists) it does
*not* guarantee that any ``setup`` is called only happens once. For
example, the session might decide to call the ``setup_module`` /
``teardown_module`` pair more than once during the execution of a test
module.

Experimental doctest support 
------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to integrate doctests, ``py.test`` now by default
picks up files matching the ``test_*.txt`` or ``*_test.txt`` 
patterns and processes them as text files containing doctests. 
This is an experimental feature and likely to change
its implementation. 

Working Examples
================

Example for managing state at module, class and method level 
------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a working example for what goes on when you setup modules, 
classes and methods:: 

    # [[from py/documentation/example/pytest/test_setup_flow_example.py]]

    def setup_module(module):
        module.TestStateFullThing.classcount = 0

    class TestStateFullThing:
        def setup_class(cls):
            cls.classcount += 1

        def teardown_class(cls):
            cls.classcount -= 1

        def setup_method(self, method):
            self.id = eval(method.func_name[5:])

        def test_42(self):
            assert self.classcount == 1
            assert self.id == 42

        def test_23(self):
            assert self.classcount == 1
            assert self.id == 23

    def teardown_module(module):
        assert module.TestStateFullThing.classcount == 0

For this example the control flow happens as follows::

    import test_setup_flow_example
    setup_module(test_setup_flow_example)
       setup_class(TestStateFullThing) 
           instance = TestStateFullThing()
           setup_method(instance, instance.test_42) 
              instance.test_42()
           setup_method(instance, instance.test_23) 
              instance.test_23()
       teardown_class(TestStateFullThing) 
    teardown_module(test_setup_flow_example)


Note that ``setup_class(TestStateFullThing)`` is called and not 
``TestStateFullThing.setup_class()`` which would require you
to insert ``setup_class = classmethod(setup_class)`` to make
your setup function callable. Did we mention that lazyness
is a virtue? 

Some ``py.test`` command-line options
=====================================

Regular options
---------------

``-v, --verbose``
    Increase verbosity. This shows a test per line while running and also
    shows the traceback after interrupting the test run with Ctrl-C.


``-x, --exitfirst``
    exit instantly on the first error or the first failed test.


``-s, --nocapture``
    disable catching of sys.stdout/stderr output.


``-k KEYWORD``
    only run test items matching the given keyword expression. You can also add
    use ``-k -KEYWORD`` to exlude tests from being run. The keyword is matched
    against filename, test class name, method name.


``-l, --showlocals``
    show locals in tracebacks: for every frame in the traceback, show the values
    of the local variables.


``--pdb``
    drop into pdb (the `Python debugger`_) on exceptions. If the debugger is
    quitted, the next test is run. This implies ``-s``.


``--tb=TBSTYLE``
    traceback verboseness: ``long`` is the default, ``short`` are the normal
    Python tracebacks, ``no`` omits tracebacks completely.


``--fulltrace``
    Don't cut any tracebacks. The default is to leave out frames if an infinite
    recursion is detected.


``--nomagic``
    Refrain from using magic as much as possible. This can be useful if you are
    suspicious that ``py.test`` somehow interferes with your program in
    unintended ways (if this is the case, please contact us!).


``--collectonly``
    Only collect tests, don't execute them.


``--traceconfig``
    trace considerations of conftest.py files. Useful when you have various
    conftest.py files around and are unsure about their interaction.

``-f, --looponfailing``
    Loop on failing test set. This is a feature you can use when you are trying
    to fix a number of failing tests: First all the tests are being run. If a
    number of tests are failing, these are run repeatedly afterwards. Every
    repetition is started once a file below the directory that you started
    testing for is changed. If one of the previously failing tests now passes,
    it is removed from the test set.

``--exec=EXECUTABLE``
    Python executable to run the tests with. Useful for testing on different
    versions of Python.



experimental options
--------------------

**Note**: these options could change in the future.


``-d, --dist``
    ad-hoc `distribute tests across machines`_ (requires conftest settings)


``-w, --startserver``
    starts local web server for displaying test progress.


``-r, --runbrowser``
    Run browser (implies --startserver).


``--boxed``
    Use boxed tests: run each test in an external process. Very useful for testing
    things that occasionally segfault (since normally the segfault then would
    stop the whole test process).

``--rest``
    `reStructured Text`_ output reporting.

.. _`Python debugger`: http://docs.python.org/lib/module-pdb.html


.. _`distribute tests across machines`:


Automated Distributed Testing
==================================

If you have a project with a large number of tests, and you have 
machines accessible through SSH, ``py.test`` can distribute
tests across the machines.  It does not require any particular
installation on the remote machine sides as it uses `py.execnet`_ 
mechanisms to distribute execution.  Using distributed testing 
can speed up your development process considerably and it
may also be useful where you need to use a remote server
that has more resources (e.g. RAM/diskspace) than your
local machine. 

*WARNING*: support for distributed testing is experimental, 
its mechanics and configuration options may change without 
prior notice.  Particularly, not all reporting features 
of the in-process py.test have been integrated into
the distributed testing approach. 

Requirements
------------

Local requirements: 

* ssh client
* python

requirements for remote machines:

* ssh daemon running
* ssh keys setup to allow login without a password
* python 
* unix like machine (reliance on ``os.fork``)

How to use it
-----------------------

When you issue ``py.test -d`` then your computer becomes
the distributor of tests ("master") and will start collecting
and distributing tests to several machines.  The machines
need to be specified in a ``conftest.py`` file.  

At start up, the master connects to each node using `py.execnet.SshGateway`_ 
and *rsyncs* all specified python packages to all nodes. 
Then the master collects all of the tests and immediately sends test item
descriptions to its connected nodes. Each node has a local queue of tests 
to run and begins to execute the tests, following the setup and teardown 
semantics.   The test are distributed at function and method level. 
When a test run on a node is completed it reports back the result
to the master. 

The master can run one of three reporters to process the events 
from the testing nodes: command line, rest output and ajaxy web based. 

.. _`py.execnet`: execnet.html
.. _`py.execnet.SshGateway`: execnet.html

Differences from local tests
----------------------------

* Test order is rather random (instead of in file order). 
* the test process may hang due to network problems 
* you may not reference files outside of rsynced directory structures

Configuration
-------------

You must create a conftest.py in any parent directory above your tests.

The options that you need to specify in that conftest.py file are:

* `dist_hosts`: a required list of host specifications
* `dist_rsync_roots` - a list of relative locations to copy to the remote machines.
* `dist_rsync_ignore` - a list of relative locations to ignore for rsyncing 
* `dist_remotepython` - the remote python executable to run.
* `dist_nicelevel` - process priority of remote nodes. 
* `dist_boxed` - will run each single test in a separate process 
  (allowing to survive segfaults for example) 
* `dist_taskspernode` - Maximum number of tasks being queued to remote nodes 

Sample configuration::

    dist_hosts = ['localhost', 'user@someserver:/tmp/somedir']
    dist_rsync_roots = ['../pypy', '../py']
    dist_remotepython = 'python2.4'
    dist_nicelevel = 10 
    dist_boxed = False
    dist_maxwait = 100 
    dist_taskspernode = 10

To use the browser-based reporter (with a nice AJAX interface) you have to tell
``py.test`` to run a small server locally using the ``-w`` or ``--startserver``
command line options. Afterwards you can point your browser to localhost:8000
to see the progress of the testing.

Development Notes
-----------------

Changing the behavior of the web based reporter requires `pypy`_ since the
javascript is actually generated fom rpython source.

.. _`pypy`: http://codespeak.net/pypy

Future/Planned Features of py.test 
==================================

integrating various test methods 
-------------------------------------------

There are various conftest.py's out there
that do html-reports, ad-hoc distribute tests
to windows machines or other fun stuff. 
These approaches should be offerred natively
by py.test at some point (requires refactorings). 
In addition, performing special checks such 
as w3c-conformance tests or ReST checks
should be offered from mainline py.test. 

more distributed testing 
-----------------------------------------

We'd like to generalize and extend our ad-hoc 
distributed testing approach to allow for running
on multiple platforms simultanously and selectively. 
The web reporter should learn to deal with driving
complex multi-platform test runs and providing 
useful introspection and interactive debugging hooks. 


move to report event based architecture
--------------------------------------------

To facilitate writing of custom reporters
py.test is to learn to generate reporting events
at all levels which a reporter can choose to 
interpret and present.  The distributed testing
approach already uses such an approach and 
we'd like to unify this with the default 
in-process py.test mode. 


see what other tools do currently (nose, etc.)
----------------------------------------------------

There are various tools out there, among them 
the nose_ clone. It's about time to look again
at these and other tools, integrate interesting
features and maybe collaborate on some issues.

Thanks for submitting a PR, your contribution is really appreciated!

Here's a quick checklist that should be present in PRs:

- [ ] Target: for bug or doc fixes, target `master`; for new features, target `features`;
- [ ] Make sure to include one or more tests for your change;
- [ ] Add yourself to `AUTHORS`;
- [ ] Add a new entry to `CHANGELOG.rst`
  * Choose any open position to avoid merge conflicts with other PRs.
  * Add a link to the issue you are fixing (if any) using RST syntax.
  * The pytest team likes to have people to acknowledged in the `CHANGELOG`, so please add a thank note to yourself ("Thanks @user for the PR") and a link to your GitHub profile. It may sound weird thanking yourself, but otherwise a maintainer would have to do it manually before or after merging instead of just using GitHub's merge button. This makes it easier on the maintainers to merge PRs.

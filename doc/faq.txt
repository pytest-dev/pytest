On naming, nosetests, licensing and magic
------------------------------------------------

Why a ``py.test`` instead of a ``pytest`` command?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Some of the reasons are historic, others are practical.  ``py.test``
used to be part of the ``py`` package which provided several developer
utilities, all starting with ``py.<TAB>``, thus providing nice
TAB-completion. If
you install ``pip install pycmd`` you get these tools from a separate
package.  These days the command line tool could be called ``pytest``
but since many people have gotten used to the old name and there
is another tool named "pytest" we just decided to stick with
``py.test``.

How does py.test relate to nose and unittest?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

py.test and nose_ share basic philosophy when it comes
to running and writing Python tests.  In fact, you can run many tests
written for nose with py.test.  nose_ was originally created
as a clone of ``py.test`` when py.test was in the ``0.8`` release
cycle.  Note that starting with pytest-2.0 support for running unittest
test suites is majorly improved and you should be able to run
many Django and Twisted test suites without modification.

What's this "magic" with py.test?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Around 2007 (version ``0.8``) some people claimed that py.test
was using too much "magic".  Partly this has been fixed by removing
unused, deprecated or complicated code.  It is today probably one
of the smallest, most universally runnable and most
customizable testing frameworks for Python.   However,
``py.test`` still uses many metaprogramming techniques and
reading its source is thus likely not something for Python beginners.

A second "magic" issue is arguably the assert statement debugging feature. When
loading test modules py.test rewrites the source code of assert statements. When
a rewritten assert statement fails, its error message has more information than
the original. py.test also has a second assert debugging technique. When an
``assert`` statement that was missed by the rewriter fails, py.test
re-interprets the expression to show intermediate values if a test fails. This
second technique suffers from a caveat that the rewriting does not: If your
expression has side effects (better to avoid them anyway!) the intermediate
values may not be the same, confusing the reinterpreter and obfuscating the
initial error (this is also explained at the command line if it happens).
You can turn off all assertion debugging with ``py.test --assertmode=off``.

Function arguments, parametrized tests and setup
-------------------------------------------------------

.. _funcargs: test/funcargs.html

Is using funcarg- versus xUnit setup a style question?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For simple applications and for people experienced with nose_ or
unittest-style test setup using `xUnit style setup`_ probably
feels natural.  For larger test suites, parametrized testing
or setup of complex test resources using funcargs_ may feel more natural.
Moreover, funcargs are ideal for writing advanced test support
code (like e.g. the monkeypatch_, the tmpdir_ or capture_ funcargs)
because the support code can register setup/teardown functions
in a managed class/module/function scope.

.. _`why pytest_pyfuncarg__ methods?`:

Why the ``pytest_funcarg__*`` name for funcarg factories?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We like `Convention over Configuration`_ and didn't see much point
in allowing a more flexible or abstract mechanism.  Moreover,
it is nice to be able to search for ``pytest_funcarg__MYARG`` in
source code and safely find all factory functions for
the ``MYARG`` function argument.

Can I yield multiple values from a funcarg factory function?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are two conceptual reasons why yielding from a factory function
is not possible:

* Calling factories for obtaining test function arguments
  is part of setting up and running a test.  At that
  point it is not possible to add new test calls to
  the test collection anymore.

* If multiple factories yielded values there would
  be no natural place to determine the combination
  policy - in real-world examples some combinations
  often should not run.

Use the `pytest_generate_tests`_ hook to solve both issues
and implement the `parametrization scheme of your choice`_.

py.test interaction with other packages
---------------------------------------------------

Issues with py.test, multiprocess and setuptools?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

On windows the multiprocess package will instantiate sub processes
by pickling and thus implicitly re-import a lot of local modules.
Unfortunately, setuptools-0.6.11 does not ``if __name__=='__main__'``
protect its generated command line script.  This leads to infinite
recursion when running a test that instantiates Processes.

A good solution is to `install Distribute`_ as a drop-in replacement
for setuptools and then re-install ``pytest``.  Otherwise you could
fix the script that is created by setuptools by inserting an
``if __name__ == '__main__'``.  Or you can create a "pytest.py"
script with this content and invoke that with the python version::

    import pytest
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        pytest.main()

On naming, nosetests, licensing and magic 
===========================================

Why the ``py`` naming? what is it? 
------------------------------------

Because the name was kind of available and there was the
idea to have the package evolve into a "standard" library 
kind of thing that works cross-python versions and is
not tied to a particular CPython revision or its release
cycle.  Clearly, this was ambitious and the naming
has maybe haunted the project rather than helping it. 
There may be a project name change and possibly a 
split up into different projects sometime. 

Why the ``py.test`` naming? 
------------------------------------

the py lib contains other command line tools that
all share the ``py.`` prefix which makes it easy
to use TAB-completion on the shell.  Another motivation
was to make it obvious where testing functionality 
for the ``py.test`` command line tool is: in the
``py.test`` package name space. 

What's py.test's relation to ``nosetests``? 
---------------------------------------------

py.test and nose_ share basic philosophy when it comes
to running Python tests.  In fact, 
with py.test-1.0.1 it is easy to run many test suites 
that currently work with ``nosetests``.  nose_ was created 
as a clone of ``py.test`` when it was in the ``0.8`` release 
cycle so some of the newer features_ introduced with py.test-1.0 
have no counterpart in nose_.

What's all this "magic" with py.test? 
----------------------------------------

"All this magic" usually boils down to two issues: 

* There is a special tweak to importing: `py/__init__.py`_ contains 
  a dictionary which maps the importable ``py.*`` namespaces to 
  objects in files.  When looking at the project source code 
  you see imports like ``from py.__.test.session import Session``. The 
  the double ``__`` underscore indicates the "normal" python 
  filesystem/namespace coupled import, i.e. it points to 
  ``py/test/session.py``'s ``Session`` object.  However, 
  from the outside you use the "non-underscore" `py namespaces`_
  so this distinction usually only shows up if you hack 
  on internal code or see internal tracebacks. 
 
* when an ``assert`` fails, py.test re-interprets the expression 
  to show intermediate values.  This allows to use the plain ``assert`` 
  statement instead of the many methods that you otherwise need 
  to mimick this behaviour.  This means that in case of a failing 
  assert, your expressions gets evaluated *twice*.  If your expression
  has side effects the outcome may be different.  If the test suddenly
  passes you will get a detailed message.  It is good practise, anyway, 
  to not have asserts with side effects.  ``py.test --nomagic`` turns
  off assert re-intepretation. 

Other than that, ``py.test`` has bugs or quirks like any other computer
software.  In fact, it has a *strong* focus on running robustly and has
over a thousand automated tests for its own code base.

function arguments and parametrized tests 
===============================================

Why the ``pytest_funcarg__*`` name for funcarg factories? 
---------------------------------------------------------------

When experimenting with funcargs an explicit registration mechanism
was considered.  But lacking a good use case for this indirection and
flexibility we decided to go for `Convention over Configuration`_ and
allow to directly specify the factory.  Besides removing the need
for an indirection it allows to "grep" for ``pytest_funcarg__MYARG`` 
and will safely find all factory functions for the ``MYARG`` function 
argument.  It helps to alleviates the de-coupling of function 
argument usage and creation.

Can i yield multiple values from a factory function? 
-----------------------------------------------------

There are two reasons why yielding from a factory function
is not possible: 

* Calling factories for obtaining test function arguments 
  is part of setting up and running a test.  At that 
  point it is not possible to add new test calls to
  the test collection anymore. 

* If multiple factories yielded values there would
  be no natural place to determine the combination 
  policy - in real-world examples some combinations
  often should not run. 

Use the `pytest_generate_tests`_ hook to solve both issues
and implement the `parametrization scheme of your choice`_.

Many of py.test's features are implemented as a plugin. 

Included plugins
================

You can find the source code of all default plugins in 
http://codespeak.net/svn/py/trunk/py/test/plugin/

plugins that add reporting asepcts
-----------------------------------

pytest_terminal: default reporter for writing info to terminals 

pytest_resultlog: log test results in machine-readable form to a file 

pytest_eventlog: log all internal pytest events to a file 

plugins for adding new test types 
-----------------------------------

pytest_unittest: run traditional unittest TestCase instances

pytest_doctest: run doctests in python modules or .txt files

pytest_restdoc: provide RestructuredText syntax and link checking

plugins for python test functions
-----------------------------------

pytest_xfail: provides "expected to fail" test marker 

pytest_tmpdir: provide temporary directories to test functions 

pytest_plugintester: generic plugin apichecks, support for functional plugin tests 

pytest_apigen: tracing values of function/method calls when running tests

Loading plugins and specifying dependencies 
============================================

py.test loads and configures plugins at tool startup:

* by reading the ``PYTEST_PLUGINS`` environment variable 
  and importing the comma-separated list of plugin names. 

* by loading all plugins specified via one or more ``-p name`` 
  command line options. 

* by loading all plugins specified via a ``pytest_plugins``
  variable in ``conftest.py`` files or test modules. 

example: ensure a plugin is loaded 
-----------------------------------

If you create a ``conftest.py`` file with the following content:: 

    pytest_plugins = "pytest_myextension",

then all tests in that directory and below it will run with
an instantiated "pytest_myextension".  Here is how instantiation
takes place:

* the module ``pytest_extension`` will be imported and 
  and its contained `ExtensionPlugin`` class will 
  be instantiated.  A plugin module may specify its 
  dependencies via another ``pytest_plugins`` definition.

advanced skipping for python test functions, classes or modules.
================================================================

With this plugin you can mark test functions for conditional skipping 
or as "xfail", expected-to-fail.  Skipping a test will avoid running it
while xfail-marked tests will run and result in an inverted outcome:
a pass becomes a failure and a fail becomes a semi-passing one. 

The need for skipping a test is usually connected to a condition.  
If a test fails under all conditions then it's probably better
to mark your test as 'xfail'. 

By passing ``-rxs`` to the terminal reporter you will see extra
summary information on skips and xfail-run tests at the end of a test run. 

.. _skipif:

Skipping a single function 
-------------------------------------------

Here is an example for marking a test function to be skipped
when run on a Python3 interpreter::

    @py.test.mark.skipif("sys.version_info >= (3,0)")
    def test_function():
        ...

During test function setup the skipif condition is 
evaluated by calling ``eval(expr, namespace)``.  The namespace
contains the  ``sys`` and ``os`` modules and the test 
``config`` object.  The latter allows you to skip based 
on a test configuration value e.g. like this::

    @py.test.mark.skipif("not config.getvalue('db')")
    def test_function(...):
        ...

Create a shortcut for your conditional skip decorator 
at module level like this::

    win32only = py.test.mark.skipif("sys.platform != 'win32'")

    @win32only
    def test_function():
        ...


skip groups of test functions 
--------------------------------------

As with all metadata function marking you can do it at
`whole class- or module level`_.  Here is an example 
for skipping all methods of a test class based on platform::

    class TestPosixCalls:
        pytestmark = py.test.mark.skipif("sys.platform == 'win32'")
    
        def test_function(self):
            # will not be setup or run under 'win32' platform
            #

The ``pytestmark`` decorator will be applied to each test function.

mark a test function as **expected to fail**
-------------------------------------------------------

You can use the ``xfail`` marker to indicate that you
expect the test to fail:: 

    @py.test.mark.xfail
    def test_function():
        ...

This test will be run but no traceback will be reported
when it fails. Instead terminal reporting will list it in the
"expected to fail" or "unexpectedly passing" sections.

Same as with skipif_ you can also selectively expect a failure
depending on platform::

    @py.test.mark.xfail("sys.version_info >= (3,0)")
    def test_function():
        ...

To not run a test and still regard it as "xfailed"::

    @py.test.mark.xfail(..., run=False)

To specify an explicit reason to be shown with xfailure detail::

    @py.test.mark.xfail(..., reason="my reason")


skipping on a missing import dependency
--------------------------------------------------

You can use the following import helper at module level 
or within a test or test setup function::

    docutils = py.test.importorskip("docutils")

If ``docutils`` cannot be imported here, this will lead to a
skip outcome of the test.  You can also skip dependeing if
if a library does not come with a high enough version::

    docutils = py.test.importorskip("docutils", minversion="0.3")

The version will be read from the specified module's ``__version__`` attribute.

imperative skip from within a test or setup function
------------------------------------------------------

If for some reason you cannot declare skip-conditions
you can also imperatively produce a Skip-outcome from 
within test or setup code.  Example::

    def test_function():
        if not valid_config():
            py.test.skip("unsuppored configuration")

command line options
--------------------


``--runxfail``
    run tests even if they are marked xfail

1. Download `pytest_skipping.py`_ plugin source code 
2. put it somewhere as ``pytest_skipping.py`` into your import path 
3. a subsequent ``py.test`` run will use your local version

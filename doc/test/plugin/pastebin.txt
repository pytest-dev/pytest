This will submit test run information to a remote Paste service and
provide a URL for each failure.  You may select tests as usual or add
for example ``-x`` if you only want to send one particular failure. 

**Creating a URL for a whole test session log**::

    py.test --pastebin=all 

Currently only pasting to the http://paste.pocoo.org service is implemented.

======================
pylib scripts 
======================

The pylib installs several scripts to support testing and (python)
development.  If working from a checkout you may also add ``bin`` to
your ``PATH`` environment variable which makes the scripts available on
your shell prompt. 

``py.test`` and ``py.test-$VERSION``
============================================

The ``py.test`` executable is the main tool that the py lib offers;
in fact most code in the py lib is geared towards supporting the
testing process.  See the `py.test documentation`_ for extensive
documentation.  The ``py.test-$VERSION`` is the same script with
an interpreter specific suffix appended to make 
several versions of py.test for using specific interpreters
accessible:

* CPython2.4: py.test-2.4 
* CPython2.5: py.test-2.5
* ... 
* CPython3.1: py.test-3.1
* Jython-2.5.1: py.test-jython
* pypy-$SUFFIX: py.test-pypy-$SUFFIX 

.. _`py.test documentation`: test/index.html

``py.which`` and ``py.which-$VERSION``
=========================================

Usage: ``py.which modulename``

Print the ``__file__`` of the module that is imported via ``import modulename``.
The version-suffix is the same as with ``py.test`` above. 

``py.cleanup``
==============

Usage: ``py.cleanup [PATH]``

Delete pyc file recursively, starting from ``PATH`` (which defaults to the
current working directory). Don't follow links and don't recurse into
directories with a ".".

``py.countloc``
===============

Usage: ``py.countloc [PATHS]``

Count (non-empty) lines of python code and number of python files recursively
starting from a ``PATHS`` given on the command line (starting from the current
working directory). Distinguish between test files and normal ones and report
them separately.

``py.lookup``
=============

Usage: ``py.lookup SEARCH_STRING [options]``

Looks recursively at Python files for a ``SEARCH_STRING``, starting from the
present working directory. Prints the line, with the filename and line-number
prepended.

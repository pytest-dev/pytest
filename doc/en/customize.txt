Basic test configuration
===================================

Command line options and configuration file settings
-----------------------------------------------------------------

You can get help on command line options and values in INI-style
configurations files by using the general help option::

    py.test -h   # prints options _and_ config file settings

This will display command line and configuration file settings
which were registered by installed plugins.

How test configuration is read from configuration INI-files
-------------------------------------------------------------

py.test searches for the first matching ini-style configuration file
in the directories of command line argument and the directories above.
It looks for file basenames in this order::

    pytest.ini
    tox.ini
    setup.cfg

Searching stops when the first ``[pytest]`` section is found.
There is no merging of configuration values from multiple files.  Example::

    py.test path/to/testdir

will look in the following dirs for a config file::

    path/to/testdir/pytest.ini
    path/to/testdir/tox.ini
    path/to/testdir/setup.cfg
    path/to/pytest.ini
    path/to/tox.ini
    path/to/setup.cfg
    ... # up until root of filesystem

If argument is provided to a py.test run, the current working directory
is used to start the search.

How to change command line options defaults
------------------------------------------------

It can be tedious to type the same series of command line options
every time you use py.test .  For example, if you always want to see
detailed info on skipped and xfailed tests, as well as have terser "dot"
progress output, you can write it into a configuration file::

    # content of pytest.ini
    # (or tox.ini or setup.cfg)
    [pytest]
    addopts = -rsxX -q

From now on, running ``py.test`` will add the specified options.

Builtin configuration file options
----------------------------------------------

.. confval:: minversion

   Specifies a minimal pytest version required for running tests.

        minversion = 2.1  # will fail if we run with pytest-2.0

.. confval:: addopts

   Add the specified ``OPTS`` to the set of command line arguments as if they
   had been specified by the user. Example: if you have this ini file content::

       [pytest]
       addopts = --maxfail=2 -rf  # exit after 2 failures, report fail info

   issuing ``py.test test_hello.py`` actually means::

       py.test --maxfail=2 -rf test_hello.py

   Default is to add no options.

.. confval:: norecursedirs

   Set the directory basename patterns to avoid when recursing
   for test discovery.  The individual (fnmatch-style) patterns are
   applied to the basename of a directory to decide if to recurse into it.
   Pattern matching characters::

        *       matches everything
        ?       matches any single character
        [seq]   matches any character in seq
        [!seq]  matches any char not in seq

   Default patterns are ``.* _* CVS {args}``. Setting a ``norecursedir``
   replaces the default.  Here is an example of how to avoid
   certain directories::

    # content of setup.cfg
    [pytest]
    norecursedirs = .svn _build tmp*

   This would tell py.test to not look into typical subversion or
   sphinx-build directories or into any ``tmp`` prefixed directory.

.. confval:: python_files

   One or more Glob-style file patterns determining which python files
   are considered as test modules.

.. confval:: python_classes

   One or more name prefixes determining which test classes
   are considered as test modules.

.. confval:: python_functions

   One or more name prefixes determining which test functions
   and methods are considered as test modules.

   See :ref:`change naming conventions` for examples.

classic xunit-style setup
========================================

.. note:: 

    This section describes the old way how you can implement setup and
    teardown on a per-module/class/function basis.  It remains fully
    supported but it is recommended to rather use :ref:`fixture functions
    <fixture>` or :ref:`funcargs <resources>` for implementing your
    needs to prepare and fix the test state for your tests.

Module level setup/teardown
--------------------------------------

If you have multiple test functions and test classes in a single
module you can optionally implement the following fixture methods
which will usually be called once for all the functions::

    def setup_module(module):
        """ setup any state specific to the execution of the given module."""

    def teardown_module(module):
        """ teardown any state that was previously setup with a setup_module
        method.
        """

Class level setup/teardown
----------------------------------

Similarly, the following methods are called at class level before
and after all test methods of the class are called::

    @classmethod
    def setup_class(cls):
        """ setup any state specific to the execution of the given class (which
        usually contains tests).
        """

    @classmethod
    def teardown_class(cls):
        """ teardown any state that was previously setup with a call to
        setup_class.
        """

Method and function level setup/teardown
-----------------------------------------------

Similarly, the following methods are called around each method invocation::

    def setup_method(self, method):
        """ setup any state tied to the execution of the given method in a
        class.  setup_method is invoked for every test method of a class.
        """

    def teardown_method(self, method):
        """ teardown any state that was previously setup with a setup_method
        call.
        """

If you would rather define test functions directly at module level
you can also use the following functions to implement fixtures::

    def setup_function(function):
        """ setup any state tied to the execution of the given function.
        Invoked for every test function in the module.
        """

    def teardown_function(function):
        """ teardown any state that was previously setup with a setup_function
        call.
        """

Note that it is possible for setup/teardown pairs to be invoked multiple times
per testing process.

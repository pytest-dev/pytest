using easy_install 
===================================================

With a working `setuptools installation`_ or `distribute installation`_ 
you can type::

    easy_install -U py 

to get the latest release of the py lib.  The ``-U`` switch
will trigger an upgrade if you already have an older version installed. 
On Linux systems you may need to execute the command as superuser and
on Windows you might need to write down the full path to ``easy_install``. 
The py lib and its tools are expected to work well on Linux,
Windows and OSX, Python versions 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 through to
the Python3 versions 3.0 and 3.1.

Working from version control or a tarball 
=================================================

To follow development or help with fixing things
for the next release, checkout the complete code
and documentation source with mercurial_::

    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/hpk42/py-trunk/

This currrently contains a 1.0.x branch and the 
default 'trunk' branch where mainline development 
takes place.  There also is a readonly subversion
checkout available::

    svn co https://codespeak.net/svn/py/dist

You can also go to the python package index and
download and unpack a TAR file::

    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/py/

activating checkout with setuptools 
--------------------------------------------

With a working `setuptools installation`_ you can issue::

    python setup.py develop 

in order to work with the tools and the lib of your checkout. 

.. _`no-setuptools`:

activating a checkout or tarball without setuptools 
-------------------------------------------------------------

To import the py lib the ``py`` package directory needs to
be on the ``$PYTHONPATH``.  If you exexute scripts directly
from ``py/bin/`` or ``py\bin\win32`` they will find their
containing py lib automatically. 

It is usually a good idea to add the parent directory of the ``py`` package 
directory to your ``PYTHONPATH`` and ``py/bin`` or ``py\bin\win32`` to your 
system wide ``PATH`` settings.  There are helper scripts that set ``PYTHONPATH`` and ``PATH`` on your system: 

on windows execute::

    # inside autoexec.bat or shell startup
    c:\\path\to\checkout\py\bin\env.cmd

on linux/OSX add this to your shell initialization:: 

    # inside .bashrc 
    eval `python ~/path/to/checkout/py/bin/env.py` 

both of which which will get you good settings 
for ``PYTHONPATH`` and ``PATH``.


note: scripts look for "nearby" py-lib 
-----------------------------------------------------

Note that the `command line scripts`_ will look 
for "nearby" py libs, so if you have a layout like this::

    mypkg/
        subpkg1/
            tests/
        tests/
    py/ 

issuing ``py.test subpkg1`` will use the py lib
from that projects root directory.

Debian and RPM packages 
===================================

As of August 2009 pytest/pylib 1.0 RPMs and Debian packages 
are not available.  You will only find 0.9 versions - 
on Debian systems look for ``python-codespeak-lib``
and Dwayne Bailey has put together a Fedora `RPM`_.

packages please use of the contact_ channels in case

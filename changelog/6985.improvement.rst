Improved :func:`pytest.approx` to enhance the readability of value ranges and tolerances between 0.001 and 1000.
  * The `repr` method now provides clearer output for values within those ranges, making it easier to interpret the results.
  * Previously, the output for those ranges of values and tolerances was displayed in scientific notation (e.g., `42 ± 1.0e+00`). The updated method now presents the tolerance as a decimal for better readability (e.g., `42 ± 1`).

    Example:

    **Previous Output:**

    .. code-block:: console

        >>> pytest.approx(42, abs=1)
        42 ± 1.0e+00

    **Current Output:**

    .. code-block:: console

        >>> pytest.approx(42, abs=1)
        42 ± 1

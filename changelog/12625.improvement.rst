Conditionally ignore collection of setuptools artifacts dirnames only if the
directories reside inside a setuptools project, i.e. `setup.cfg` is present alongside
a `setup.py` or a `pyproject.toml` with setuptools configuration inside.
You can use the new `--collect-in-build` to force collection of ignored directories.

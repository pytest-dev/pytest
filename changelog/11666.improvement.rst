Improved the terminal writer to be able to use pygments Terminal256Formatter and TerminalTrueColorFormatter.

These can be set by the user with the environmental variable PYTEST_THEME.

There is also a default format set with both a light and dark mode which can be changed with the environmental variable PYTEST_THEME_MODE.

If no environmental variables are set it defaults to dark mode.

**PytestRemovedIn9Warning deprecation warnings are now errors by default.**

Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as
possible, all warnings of type ``PytestRemovedIn9Warning`` now generate errors
instead of warning messages by default.

**The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 9.1**, so please consult the
:ref:`deprecations` section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.

In the pytest ``9.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a
stopgap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:

.. code-block:: ini

    [pytest]
    filterwarnings =
        ignore::pytest.PytestRemovedIn9Warning

But this will stop working when pytest ``9.1`` is released.

**If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a
comment to :issue:`13779`.

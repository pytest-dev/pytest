Fixed conftest.py fixture scoping when ``testpaths`` points outside ``rootdir``.

Previously, fixtures from nested conftest.py files would incorrectly leak to sibling directories
when using a relative ``testpaths`` like ``../tests/sdk``.

Conftest fixtures are now parsed during Directory collection, using the Directory node for
proper scoping. Additionally, nodeids for paths outside ``rootdir`` are now computed more
meaningfully: paths in site-packages use a ``site://`` prefix, nearby paths use relative
paths with ``..`` components, and far-away paths use absolute paths.

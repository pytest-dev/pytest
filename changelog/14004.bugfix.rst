Fixed conftest.py fixture scoping when ``testpaths`` points outside ``rootdir``.

Previously, fixtures from nested conftest.py files would incorrectly leak to sibling directories
when using a relative ``testpaths`` like ``../tests/sdk``.

Conftest fixtures are now parsed during Directory collection, using the Directory node's
nodeid for proper scoping.

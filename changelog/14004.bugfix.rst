Fixed conftest.py fixture scoping when ``testpaths`` points outside ``rootdir``.

Nodeids for paths outside ``rootdir`` are now computed more meaningfully:
paths in site-packages use a ``site://`` prefix, nearby paths use relative
paths with ``..`` components, and far-away paths use absolute paths.

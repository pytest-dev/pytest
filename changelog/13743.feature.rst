Added support for native TOML configuration files.

While pytest, since version 6, supports configuration in ``pyproject.toml`` files under ``[tool.pytest.ini_options]``,
it does so in an "INI compatibility mode", where all configuration values are treated as strings or list of strings.
Now, pytest supports the native TOML data model.

In ``pyproject.toml``, the native TOML configuration is under the ``[tool.pytest]`` table.

.. code-block:: toml

    # pyproject.toml
    [tool.pytest]
    minversion = "9.0"
    addopts = ["-ra", "-q"]
    testpaths = [
        "tests",
        "integration",
    ]

The ``[tool.pytest.ini_options]`` table remains supported, but both tables cannot be used at the same time.

If you prefer to use a separate configuration file, or don't use ``pyproject.toml``, you can use ``pytest.toml`` or ``.pytest.toml``:

.. code-block:: toml

    # pytest.toml or .pytest.toml
    [pytest]
    minversion = "9.0"
    addopts = ["-ra", "-q"]
    testpaths = [
        "tests",
        "integration",
    ]

The documentation now shows configuration snippets in both TOML and INI formats, in a tabbed interface.

See :ref:`config file formats` for full details.

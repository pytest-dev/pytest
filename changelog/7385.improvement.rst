``--junitxml`` now includes the exception cause in the ``message`` XML attribute for failures during setup and teardown. 

Previously:

.. code-block:: xml

    <error message="test setup failure">
    
Now:

.. code-block:: xml

    <error message="failed on setup with &quot;ValueError: Some error during setup&quot;">

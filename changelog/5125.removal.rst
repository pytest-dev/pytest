``Session.exitcode`` values are now coded in ``pytest.ExitCode``, an ``IntEnum``. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.

The team doesn't expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.

**pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to ``1.29.0`` or later, as ``pytest-xdist`` required a compatibility fix because of this change.

Add a recipe for handling abstract test classes in the documentation.

A new example has been added to the documentation to demonstrate how to use a mixin class to handle abstract
test classes without manually setting the ``__test__`` attribute for subclasses.
This ensures that subclasses of abstract test classes are automatically collected by pytest.

The change log draft preview integration has been refactored to use a
third party extension ``sphinxcontib-towncrier``. The previous in-repo
script was putting the change log preview file at
:file:`doc/en/_changelog_towncrier_draft.rst`. Said file is no longer
ignored in Git and might show up among untracked files in the
development environments of the contributors. To address that, the
contributors can run the following command that will clean it up:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clean -x -i -- doc/en/_changelog_towncrier_draft.rst

-- by :user:`webknjaz`

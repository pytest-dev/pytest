Fixed handling of test methods with positional-only parameter syntax.

Now, methods are supported that formally define ``self`` as positional-only
and/or fixture parameters as keyword-only, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

    class TestClass:

        def test_method(self, /, *, fixture): ...

Before, this caused an internal error in pytest.

Plugins specified in the :globalvar:`pytest_plugins` config setting and
:envvar:`PYTEST_PLUGINS` environment variable now allow using
:ref:`entry points <pip-installable plugins>` names additionally to the
importable definitions. Prior to this release, these identifiers used to only
work with the ``-p`` CLI option -- by :user:`mtelka` and :user:`webknjaz`.

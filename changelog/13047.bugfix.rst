Bug Fix :func:`pytest.approx` to restore consistent handling of equality checks between `bool` and `numpy.bool_` types.
  * This behavior was accidentally changed in version 8.3.4 and has now been restored to match the behavior of version 8.3.3.
  * Users relying on comparisons between `bool` and `numpy.bool_` can now expect consistent results as before.

    Example:

    **Behavior on pytest 8.3.4:**

    .. code-block:: console

        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from pytest import approx
        >>> np.False_ == pytest.approx(False)
        False

    **Behavior on pytest 8.3.3:**

    .. code-block:: console

        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from pytest import approx
        >>> np.False_ == pytest.approx(False)
        True

Restore :func:`pytest.approx` handling of equality checks between `bool` and `numpy.bool_` types.

Comparing `bool` and `numpy.bool_` using :func:`pytest.approx` accidentally changed in version `8.3.4` and `8.3.5` to no longer match:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from pytest import approx
    >>> [np.True_, np.True_] == pytest.approx([True, True])
    False

This has now been fixed:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> [np.True_, np.True_] == pytest.approx([True, True])
    True

The readability of assertion introspection of bound methods has been enhanced
-- by :user:`farbodahm`, :user:`webknjaz`, :user:`obestwalter`, :user:`flub`
and :user:`glyphack`.

Earlier, it was like:

.. code-block:: console

    =================================== FAILURES ===================================
    _____________________________________ test _____________________________________

        def test():
    >       assert Help().fun() == 2
    E       assert 1 == 2
    E        +  where 1 = <bound method Help.fun of <example.Help instance at 0x256a830>>()
    E        +    where <bound method Help.fun of <example.Help instance at 0x256a830>> = <example.Help instance at 0x256a830>.fun
    E        +      where <example.Help instance at 0x256a830> = Help()

    example.py:7: AssertionError
    =========================== 1 failed in 0.03 seconds ===========================


And now it's like:

.. code-block:: console

    =================================== FAILURES ===================================
    _____________________________________ test _____________________________________

        def test():
    >       assert Help().fun() == 2
    E       assert 1 == 2
    E        +  where 1 = fun()
    E        +    where fun = <test_local.Help object at 0x1074be230>.fun
    E        +      where <test_local.Help object at 0x1074be230> = Help()

    test_local.py:13: AssertionError
    =========================== 1 failed in 0.03 seconds ===========================

Added a new `faulthandler_exit_on_timeout` ini option set to "false" by default to let `faulthandler` interrupt the `pytest` process after a timeout in case of deadlock.

Previously, a `faulthandler` timeout would only dump the traceback of all threads to stderr, but would not interrupt the `pytest` process.

Add `--xfail-tb` flag, which turns traceback output for XFAIL results.

* If the `--xfail-tb` flag is not sent, tracebacks for XFAIL results are NOT shown.
* The style of traceback for XFAIL is set with `--tb`, and can be `auto|long|short|line|native|no`.
* Note: Even if you have `--xfail-tb` set, you won't see them if `--tb=no`.

Some history:

* This is a behavior break, but brings default behavior back to pre-8.0.0 behavior.
* With this change, default `-rx`/ `-ra` behavior is identical to pre-8.0 with respect to xfail tracebacks.
* With pytest 8.0, `-rx` or `-ra` would not only turn on summary reports for xfail, but also report the tracebacks for xfail results.
* This caused issues with some projects that utilize xfail, but don't want to see all of the xfail tracebacks.
* This change detaches xfail tracebacks from `-rx`, and now we turn on xfail tracebacks with `--xfail-tb`.

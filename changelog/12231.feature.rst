Add `--xfail-tb` flag, which acts a lot like `--tb`, but controls the traceback output for XFAIL results.   

* The `--xfail-tb` flag takes one argument, `auto|long|short|line|native|no`, and defaults to `no`.  
* To turn on xfail tracebacks, pass in `-rx` or `-ra` along with `--xfail-tb=short` (or any of `auto`, `long`, `short`, `line`, or `native`).

The `--tb` flag, that controls normal test failure tracebacks, defaults to `auto`.  
This change really only separates the traceback behavior of normal vs xfail failures.

Some history:  

* This is a behavior break, but brings default behavior back to pre-8.0.0 behavior.
* With this change, default `-rx`/ `-ra` behavior is identical to pre-8.0 with respect to xfail tracebacks.
* With pytest 8.0, `-rx` or `-ra` would not only turn on summary reports for xfail, but also report the tracebacks for xfail results.
* This caused issues with some projects that utilize xfail, but don't want to see all of the xfail tracebacks.

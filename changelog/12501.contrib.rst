The changelog configuration has been updated to introduce more accurate
audience-tailored categories. Previously, there was a ``trivial``
change log fragment type with an unclear and broad meaning. It was
removed and we now have ``contrib``, ``misc`` and ``packaging`` in
place of it.

The new change note types target the readers who are downstream
packagers and project contributors. Additionally, the miscellaneous
section is kept for unspecified updates that do not fit anywhere else.

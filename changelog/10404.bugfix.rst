Apply filterwarnings from config/cli as soon as possible, and revert them as late as possible
so that warnings as errors are collected throughout the pytest run and before the
unraisable and threadexcept hooks are removed.

This allows very late warnings and unraisable/threadexcept exceptions to fail the test suite.

This also changes the warning that the lsof plugin issues from PytestWarning to the new warning PytestFDWarning so it can be more easily filtered.

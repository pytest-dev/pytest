``py.path.local`` arguments for hooks have been deprecated. See :ref:`the deprecation note <legacy-path-hooks-deprecated>` for full details.

``py.path.local`` arguments to Node constructors have been deprecated. See :ref:`the deprecation note <node-ctor-fspath-deprecation>` for full details.

.. note::
    The name of the ``Node`` arguments and attributes (old ``fspath``, new ``path``) is **the opposite**
    of the situation for hooks (old ``path``, new ``fspath``).
    This is an unfortunate artifact due to historical reasons, which should be
    resolved in future versions as we slowly get rid of the :pypi:`py`
    dependency (see :issue:`9283` for a longer discussion).

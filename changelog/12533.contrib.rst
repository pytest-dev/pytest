The ``extlinks`` Sphinx extension is no longer enabled. The ``:bpo:``
role it used to declare has been removed with that. BPO itself has
migrated to GitHub some years ago and it is possible to link the
respective issues by using their GitHub issue numbers and the
``:issue:`` role that the ``sphinx-issues`` extension implements.

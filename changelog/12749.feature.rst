pytest traditionally collects classes/functions in the test module namespace even if they are imported from another file.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    # contents of src/domain.py
    class Testament: ...


    # contents of tests/test_testament.py
    from domain import Testament


    def test_testament(): ...

In this scenario with the default options, pytest will collect the class `Testament` from `tests/test_testament.py` because it starts with `Test`, even though in this case it is a production class being imported in the test module namespace.

This behavior can now be prevented by setting the new :confval:`collect_imported_tests` configuration option to ``false``, which will make pytest collect classes/functions from test files **only** if they are defined in that file.

Requesting an asynchronous fixture without a `pytest_fixture_setup` hook that resolves it will now give a DeprecationWarning. This most commonly happens if a sync test requests an async fixture. This should have no effect on a majority of users with async tests or fixtures using async pytest plugins, but may affect non-standard hook setups or ``autouse=True``. For guidance on how to work around this warning see :ref:`sync-test-async-fixture`.

Clarified in the documentation that hook implementations defined in ``conftest.py`` files are not available during ``pytest_addoption()`` execution, as conftest files are discovered and loaded after plugin initialization. Only hooks from builtin plugins, plugins loaded via ``-p``, installed third-party plugins, or plugins from ``PYTEST_PLUGINS`` environment variable are accessible at that stage.

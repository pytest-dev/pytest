Clarified in the documentation that hook implementations defined in ``conftest.py`` files are not available to other plugins during their ``pytest_addoption()`` execution, as conftest files are discovered and loaded after builtin and third-party plugins have been initialized. However, initial conftest files themselves can implement ``pytest_addoption()`` to add their own command-line options.

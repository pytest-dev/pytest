:func:`~pytest.warns` now re-emits unmatched warnings when the context
closes -- previously it would consume all warnings, hiding those that were not
matched by the function.

While this is a new feature, we decided to announce this as a breaking change
because many test suites are configured to error-out on warnings, and will
therefore fail on the newly-re-emitted warnings.

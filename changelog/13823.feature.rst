Added a :confval:`strict` configuration option to enable all strictness-related options.

When set to ``true``, the :confval:`strict` option currently enables

* :confval:`strict_config`
* :confval:`strict_markers`
* :confval:`strict_parametrization_ids`
* :confval:`strict_xfail`

The individual strictness options can be explicitly set to override the global :confval:`strict` setting.

The previously-deprecated ``--strict`` command-line flag now enables strict mode.

If pytest adds new strictness options in the future, they will also be enabled in strict mode.
Therefore, you should only enable strict mode if you use a pinned/locked version of pytest,
or if you want to proactively adopt new strictness options as they are added.

See :ref:`strict mode` for more details.

Emit a ``PytestCollectionWarning`` when a module-level ``__getattr__`` returns ``None`` for ``pytestmark`` instead of raising ``AttributeError``.

Previously this caused a cryptic ``TypeError: got None instead of Mark`` error.
Now pytest issues a helpful warning and continues collecting the module normally.

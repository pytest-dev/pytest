Fixed fixture discovery to preserve definition order instead of using alphabetical sorting.

This ensures that fixtures are processed in the order they appear in source code,
which is important for autouse fixtures and fixture overriding with the ``name`` parameter.
Previously, using ``dir()`` for fixture discovery caused alphabetical sorting, leading to
unexpected behavior when fixtures with the same name were defined at different scopes.

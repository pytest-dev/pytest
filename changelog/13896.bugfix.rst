The terminal progress feature added in pytest 9.0.0 has been disabled by default, except on Windows, due to compatibility issues with some terminal emulators.

You may enable it again by passing ``-p terminalprogress``. We may enable it by default again once compatibility improves in the future.

Additionally, when the environment variable ``TERM`` is ``dumb``, the escape codes are no longer emitted, even if the plugin is enabled.

Terminal tab progress reporting

Added support for displaying test progress in the terminal tab using OSC 9;4; ANSI sequence.
When pytest runs in a supported terminal emulator (like GNOME Terminal or ConEmu),
you'll see the test progress as a percentage in the terminal tab, allowing you to monitor
test execution progress without having to switch to the pytest tab.

This feature is automatically enabled when running in a compatible terminal and requires
no additional configuration.
